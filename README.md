# **Pico Park Clone: Multiplayer Game**

## **Project Overview**

This project is a **Pico Park Clone**, a multiplayer cooperative puzzle game. Players collaborate to solve various puzzles, each player controlling a character to complete objectives. The game utilizes **Python** for the backend with **Socket Programming** for networking, and **JavaScript** for the frontend to handle game logic and rendering.

The project is designed to be played by multiple players, where each player can join a room and interact with other players in real-time.

## **Key Features**

-   **Multiplayer Support**: Multiple players can join the same game room and interact with each other.
-   **Real-Time Communication**: Players' positions and actions are synchronized in real-time using WebSockets.
-   **Room Management**: Players can create and join rooms using unique room codes.
-   **Dynamic Rendering**: The game features dynamic rendering of player movements and interactions.

## **Technologies Used**

-   **Python (Socket Programming)**: The backend for handling game state, player connections, and real-time synchronization.
-   **JavaScript**: Handles the frontend, including rendering, player inputs, and real-time updates.
-   **WebSocket**: For real-time communication between the server and clients.
-   **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the game pages.

## **Installation**

### **Backend Setup (Python)**

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/picoParkClone.git](https://github.com/yourusername/picoParkClone.git)
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd picoParkClone
    ```
3.  Install necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  Run the server:
    ```bash
    python server.py
    ```

### **Frontend Setup (JavaScript)**

1.  Ensure that the `www` folder is correctly served by your web server.
2.  Open the `index.html` or `game.html` in a browser to start the game.

## **How to Play**

1.  **Create Room**: A player can create a new room by clicking the "Create Room" button. The server will generate a unique room code.
2.  **Join Room**: Players can join a room by entering the room code generated by another player.
3.  **Multiplayer Sync**: Players can interact with each other in real-time. Their movements and actions will be broadcast to all players in the room.
4.  **Gameplay**: Solve puzzles and complete tasks by collaborating with other players.

## **How It Works**

-   **Room Management**: Players can create a room or join an existing room using a unique code. The server maintains the list of active rooms.
-   **Real-Time State Sync**: Whenever a player moves or interacts, the server broadcasts the updated state to all clients in the room using WebSocket.
-   **Frontend Rendering**: The frontend receives real-time updates and renders the game state accordingly, including player positions and interactions.

## **Code Structure**

-   `server.py`: The server-side code handling room management, player connections, and state synchronization.
-   `app.py`: Main entry point to run the backend server and initialize WebSocket connections.
-   `www/`: The frontend directory containing HTML, CSS, JS files, and assets used to render the game in the browser.
    -   `index.html`: Main game page where players can join or create rooms.
    -   `game.html`: Gameplay screen where real-time interactions happen.
-   `src/`: JavaScript files managing the game logic and rendering.
-   `assets/`: Images, fonts, and other assets used in the game.
