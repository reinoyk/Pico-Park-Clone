## Overview

This project is a **Pico Park Clone**, a multiplayer cooperative puzzle game. Players collaborate to solve various puzzles, each player controlling a character to complete objectives. The game utilizes **Python** for the backend with **Socket Programming** for networking, and **JavaScript** for the frontend to handle game logic and rendering.

The project is designed to be played by multiple players, where each player can join a room and interact with other players in real-time.

**Why Pico-Park-Clone?**

This project empowers developers to build engaging, collaborative multiplayer experiences with ease. The core features include:

- 🧩 **🌐 WebSocket & WebRTC Communication:** Facilitates real-time, peer-to-peer multiplayer interactions.
- 🎮 **🖥️ Desktop App Integration:** Uses PyWebView to run the game as a standalone desktop application.
- 🛠️ **📝 Level Editor & Customization:** Provides web-based tools for designing and sharing game levels.
- ⚙️ **🧪 Physics Simulation:** Leverages Matter.js for realistic interactions and environment dynamics.
- 🚀 **🔌 Modular Architecture:** Supports dynamic module loading and scalable development.

**Technologies Used**

-   **Python (Socket Programming)**: The backend for handling game state, player connections, and real-time synchronization.
-   **JavaScript**: Handles the frontend, including rendering, player inputs, and real-time updates.
-   **WebSocket**: For real-time communication between the server and clients.
-   **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the game pages.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project requires the following dependencies:

- **Programming Language:** JavaScript
- **Package Manager:** Npm

### Installation

Build Pico-Park-Clone from the source and install dependencies:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    ❯ git clone https://github.com/reinoyk/Pico-Park-Clone
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```sh
    ❯ cd Pico-Park-Clone
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**

**Using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):**

```sh
❯ npm install
```

### Usage

Run the project with:

**Using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):**

```sh
npm start
```

## **How to Play**

1.  **Create Room**: A player can create a new room by clicking the "Create Room" button. The server will generate a unique room code.
2.  **Join Room**: Players can join a room by entering the room code generated by another player.
3.  **Multiplayer Sync**: Players can interact with each other in real-time. Their movements and actions will be broadcast to all players in the room.
4.  **Gameplay**: Solve puzzles and complete tasks by collaborating with other players.

## **How It Works**

-   **Room Management**: Players can create a room or join an existing room using a unique code. The server maintains the list of active rooms.
-   **Real-Time State Sync**: Whenever a player moves or interacts, the server broadcasts the updated state to all clients in the room using WebSocket.
-   **Frontend Rendering**: The frontend receives real-time updates and renders the game state accordingly, including player positions and interactions.
